                <h2>Bouncing Window</h2>
                <p>
                  <a href="https://github.com/colinjbakker/BouncingWindow">Bouncing Window</a> is a window that allows the user to throw a red square around their screen.
					        Programmed in C++ using the <a href="https://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a> library.
					        The biggest challenge was getting the window to rotate. I solved this by creating bitmaps representing different angles, which could be used to change the window's shape, and swapped between them depending on the window's angle.
					        In the future I want to clean up the code, and possibly remake the project entirely.
					        I also want to improve the rotational physics.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <a href="https://github.com/colinjbakker/FPSGame2">FPS Game</a> is my entry into 3D graphics.
					        Programmed in C++ with the help of <a href="https://www.raylib.com/">raylib</a>.
					        Biggest challenge was refreshing my linear algebra knowledge for working in 3D, especially with the camera.
					        Want to add mode game-like features like upgrades and weapons if there is a lull in my schoolwork or over the winter.
					        Also want to make the graphics look better, currently enrolled in computer graphics, so hopefully I learn helpful information for this project.

                <h2>Wordle</h2>
                <p>
                  Wordle Clone is a clone of the game Wordle created using JavaFx for a school project.
                  Although the professor asked us to create it using <a href="https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/">SceneBuilder</a>, I decided to program all of 
                  the GUI elements manually at the advice of <a href="https://www.pragmaticcoding.ca/beginners/intro">this article</a> by Dave Barrett.
                  This was difficult, but it gave me a far greater understanding of how GUI elements are created and interact, and sparked my interest in creating more graphical applications.

                <h2>Pong</h2>
                <p>
                  <a href="https://github.com/colinjbakker/Pong">Pong</a> was my first introduction to OpenGL.
					        I made this after learning OpenGl on <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">learnopengl.com</a> written by <a href="https://joeydevries.com/#home">Joey de Vries</a>.
					        The biggest challenge was getting OpenGL, GLFW, and GLAD running and linked to my project.
					        Ultimately, this project was more about getting more comfortable working with libraries in C++ than the actual game itself.
					        I am still proud of my AI enemy paddle who predicts the movement of the ball and positions itself to create an extremely difficult return. 
					        I haven't been able to score even a single point against it.

                  <a href="https://github.com/colinjbakker/mouse-distance-tracker">Mouse Distance Tracker</a> was a fun,
                  quick project I created to track how far, in meters, my mouse moves on my screen.
                  Created using Python and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html">tkinter</a>,
                  <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/">pyautogui</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/screeninfo/">screeninfo</a> packages.

                <h2>Paint</h2>
                <p>
                  Paint was a school project for computer graphics where we utilized OpenGL to create a drawing application.
                  The point of the project was to gain an understanding of how the frame buffers of OpenGL work, and how user input is handled.
                  Includes a way to change the color of the brush, background, as well as different brush shapes and types.
